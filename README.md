## Project Description

Your task is to build an awesome web application as a group! Mix and match
libraries and APIs to build a useful front-end web application.

You will be using the front-end skills you have developed throughout Phase 1:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Bootstrap, APIs, etc.

Each team will present their project on **Saturday, December 1st**.

> As a reminder, there will be no class on Nov 22 and 24th for Thanksgiving Break.

## Technical Requirements

Your application **must**:

- Use at least one JavaScript library that is not jQuery. Examples:
  - [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
  - [Marked](https://marked.js.org/)
  - [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/)
  - [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/)

- Use a CSS framework. Examples:
  - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

  - Note that you do not need to purchase a domain name for your project. But it
    should be reachable via a public URL somewhere.

- Your repo must be connected to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/):
  - You must run at least one test in your Travis CI build (hint: test for [StandardJS])
